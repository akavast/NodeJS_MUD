#NodeJS_MUD

This is a University of Southampton individual NodeJS project.

The task was to complete the implementation of a Multi-User Dungeon game by adding in various methods in the [Commands.js](/scripts/Commands.js) file. The implementation spans from the **look** command (line 220) to the end of the file.
